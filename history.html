          Hope Raisers Global Foundation: A Legacy of Empowerment and Transformation
        </h2>
      
        <p>
          Hope Raisers Global Foundation was founded in 2017 officially by Angonimi David-Imeh, a visionary leader driven by a passion to empower marginalized communities and promote sustainable development.

          Early Years (2011-2017)
        </h3>
        <p>
          This was the early years before the name Hope Raisers Global Foundation was incorporated in 2017. We had a children's fun fair December of 2011. That year was a trying year for my family that was battling infertility. Rather than stay glued on our problems we decided to make lemonade with our lemons. We turned to celebrate the festive season with marginalized children that year's Christmas. With over 2000 children in attendance, a good number of primary schools partnered with us and the Aba Sports Club gave us their complex which was used as the venue for the outreach.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two days event was characterised by music, fun fair, dance, different games/competition and there was a lot to eat, drink and gifts to take home. It eventually ended on a good note. That December, my family conceived our first child. The funfair heralded the birth of my family's lovely princess. What a joy?
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Fast forward to 2015 in the city of Owerri, Imo State where we relocated to, we launched a women group called “Christian Women In Business” where a group of passionate women came together to give pep talks at different girls secondary schools, we also supported the girls with sanitary towels. This we did for three years, from 2015 to 2017. It halted due to lack of funds.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          2016-2018 we supported women with products, these were homemakers whose job was to keep the home while the husband is the sole breadwinner. We started an entrepreneurial journey which we couldn't sustain because of lack of funding. Though we recorded some level of success but we had to soft pedal in order not to run into debts.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The foundation's journey again picked up in 2021 after the passing of my family's third child. I needed a way to deal with the grief that was how we found ourselves at the IDP Camp in FCT, Abuja. We focused on providing humanitarian aid to internally displaced persons (IDPs) in FCT, Nigeria. The organization's initial efforts were centered on delivering emergency assistance, including food, shelter, and medical care. Teaching of the IDP children weekly for three years.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          As the foundation grew, it expanded its scope to include education, economic empowerment, and advocacy programs. This strategic shift marked a significant turning point in the organization's history, as it began to address the root causes of poverty and inequality.

          Deborah's story is one that's so touching:
        </p>
        <p>
          Deborah is a mother of four, the insurgency brought her and her entire family to the Durumi IDP camp where they had lived for over five years before Hope Raisers Global Foundation met with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing she always asked for was a sewing machine since she had honed the skill of sewing clothes. She was certain that if we could provide her with a sewing machine she would leave the IDP camp back to her state of origin.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was a challenge as we never saw anyone who was so determined and zealous like Deborah.
        </p>
        <p>
          We took up the challenge in 2022 and got Deborah a brand new sewing machine. The day she got the sewing machine it felt like heaven had kissed the earth as her joy was contagious and her gratitude was palpable.
        </p>
        <p>
          She left the camp within the same week to her state of origin. As at October 2024 when we heard about Deborah, we vowed to play our role in nation building through social development as Deborah is now a shop owner with additional sewing machines, she is giving back to her community by teaching other women whose passion is on fashion design.
